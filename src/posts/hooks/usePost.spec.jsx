// Task 1: test the usePost hook here.
// Acceptance criteria:
// 1) Include a test that intercepts the post by id request and assert the returned data has the correct structure.
// 2) Include a test that covers passing extra arguments to usePost
// (e.g. when passing enabled = true, assert that the useQuery hook is called
// with an object that contains enabled: true).
