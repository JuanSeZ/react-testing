// Task 4: test the PasswordTab component here, aiming for 100% coverage.
// Acceptance criteria:
// 1) Add form validation that makes sense, as a minimum:

// - `New password` can't be equal to `Current password`.
// - `New password` must match the `Repeat new password`.

// To build the form and the validation schema, you can follow a similar approach as in the AccountTab component.

// 2) When the form has no errors and is submitted, show a toast with:

// - Title: `Success`.
// - Text: `Password changed`.

// 3) Add tests aiming to cover all the functionality.
